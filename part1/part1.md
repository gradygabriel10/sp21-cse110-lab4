12. A. console.log(student.name) B. student.greeting()

12. A. student.name   B. student['Grade Year'] C. student.greeting() D. student['Favorite Teacher'] E. student.courseload
13. A. 32, since integers map to their exact string representation B. 1, 3 becomes an integer and subtracts by 2 because '-' is a mathematical operation C. 3, null acts like zero D. 3null, null becomes string because the 3 is a string E. 4, true acts like a binary number 1 F. 0, false acts like a binary number 0 and adds by null G. 3undefined, undefined becomes a string because the 3 is a string H. NaN, 3 becomes an integer and undefined becomes NaN due to the mathermatical operation '-'
14. A. True, 2 acts as an integer and compares by 1 B. False, 2 and 12 act act like a string and compare between each other C. True, '2' acts as an integer and compares if it's equal to 2   D. False, compare if 2 and '2' have the same data type or not  E. False, true acts like a binary number 1 and compare by 2  F. True, boolean(2) acts like a boolean true and compares if it has the same data type as boolean true
15.  == uses for comparing two variables and ignores the datatype of the variable. === also uses for comparing two variables with checks their datatype.

17.  Here, we have a function called 'modifyArray'. First, this functions declares an empty array named 'newArr'. Then, it has a for loop that iterates over the parameter array which is [1,2,3] and pushes the result of a function 'doSomething' based on the second parameter of the 'modifyArray'. 'doSomething' returns a value by multiplying the parameter by 2, which is [2,4,6]. Therefore, the results goes to the 'newArr' and 'modifyArray' returns the element inside 'newArr'.
